## Installation

For the Frontend:
Likewise, open the Terminal for the frontend and type "npm install". This will install the essential components required by the application on the frontend (Axios, Bootstrap, Recharts, React-Redux, etc).

You would also need to connect to MongoDB database to be able to create and seed the database.

- Start by connecting to the MongoDB Database.

In the backend terminal:
- Use the command "npm run seed:data" to seed data into the MongoDB database.
- Type "node server.js" to run the backend server.
